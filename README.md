## Description 

Using the inquirer and fs npm packages, users are able to generate a README>md documents usign just a command-line application.

This application allows for users to answer a series of questions to fill in the necessary of the README template. The inquirer package (version 8.2.4) consists of prompts relating to the README. Responses to these prompts then substitute the placeholders (${}) in the template literal that houses the README template. The writeFile method of File system (fs) creates a new README.md document based on the responses and template literal.  

## Portfolio Example

Since the scheduler displays the hours in 12-hour notation, I had also labeled the div ids in the same way. For example, 1pm was "id='hour 1'. However, this created complexity when I was trying to format the hours on the the scheduler to match the current hour. 


```function gatherCrit() {
<div id="hour-1" class="row time-block">
```

By switching the 24-hour notation on the the id only, rather than the scheduler, I was able to write code gave the id an number type that could be compared with the current hour through dayjs. 

```
<div id="hour-13" class="row time-block">
```

## Learning Points 

This project helped me understand the importance of scopes among tags and their relationships to one another. While I have been able to identify parent, child, and sibling tags, I did not have a fully understanding of their relevance to writing code if I could simply refer the the tag, id, or class name. 

Since I may want to target code tags, ids, and classes that have varying names in similar ways, calling on the nearest parent, child, or siblings will address them at once.
