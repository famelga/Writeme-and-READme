## Description 

Using the inquirer and fs npm packages, users are able to generate templateREADME.md documents using just a command-line application.

This application allows for users to answer a series of questions to fill in the necessary of the README template. The inquirer package (version 8.2.4) consists of prompts relating to the README. Responses to these prompts then substitute the placeholders (${}) in the template literal that houses the README template. The writeFile method of File system (fs) creates a new templateREADME.md document based on the responses and template literal.  

## Portfolio Example

Responses to the prompts were traversed from prompt using the name key to target the corressponding with the placeholders. 


```    inquirer
    .prompt([
        { 
            type: "input",
            name: "fullName",
            message: "What is your full name?",
        },
```

The user's name is target using the syntax "answer.fullName" based on their response to the prompt above. 

```
${answer.fullName}
```


## Usage 

Use command-line to generate a templateREADME.md document.

## Learning Points 

This project helped me understand how to use the inquirer package to gather data based on user-input. assigning unique names to the "name" keys was essential so that the correct responses were being referenced. 

Also, I become more familiar with using back-ticks to contain template literals. Initially, I was using single-quotes, which resulted in errors and the text not being grouped together. Once I noticed my error, the selected text were uniform-color, symbolizing that the template literals would be functional.
