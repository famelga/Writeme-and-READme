## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://famelga.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/)

This calendar application follows the 9-5 work schedule, and allows the user to add events. The application is also color-coded based on current hour. 

Most of the html was completed, with the exception of 12pm-5pm. Using the same formatting as the previous time-blocks, I added code to create the missing hours. While the scheduler displays the hours in a 12-hour format, the div ids were labeled using the format of a 24-clock. I did this so that I could use less than, greater than, and equal to in the if/else conditional statements that were used to assign color to the textarea boxes. I also had to remove the "past", "present", "future" classes from the parent div tags so that it would not override JQuery.

I used the for each function instead of a for loop because the for each iterates through every section and passes a callback function. With the time-block class, the function added either a past, present, or future class based on the relationship between the 24-clock div ids and current hour, which was pulled from dayjs. 

Additionally, I was able to pull the current date using dayjs format, and using the text property to display the date from JavaScript to the HTML.

## Portfolio Example

Since the scheduler displays the hours in 12-hour notation, I had also labeled the div ids in the same way. For example, 1pm was "id='hour 1'. However, this created complexity when I was trying to format the hours on the the scheduler to match the current hour. 


```function gatherCrit() {
<div id="hour-1" class="row time-block">
```

By switching the 24-hour notation on the the id only, rather than the scheduler, I was able to write code gave the id an number type that could be compared with the current hour through dayjs. 

```
<div id="hour-13" class="row time-block">
```

## Learning Points 

This project helped me understand the importance of scopes among tags and their relationships to one another. While I have been able to identify parent, child, and sibling tags, I did not have a fully understanding of their relevance to writing code if I could simply refer the the tag, id, or class name. 

Since I may want to target code tags, ids, and classes that have varying names in similar ways, calling on the nearest parent, child, or siblings will address them at once.
